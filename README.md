# stripe-rdc-ios
An internal iOS app for testing mobile MiSnap integration with Remote Deposit Capture APIs

You should integrate this app using your own MiSnapSDK. The SDK should be placed in the top-level app directory (rdc-sample-app/MiSnapSDK). You should also substitute the Stripe API keys and account IDs in rdc-sample-app/RDC Testing/Constants.swift with your own. If you encounter any problems, contact Stripe for assistance.
